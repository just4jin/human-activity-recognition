Weight Lifting Exercises dataset (source: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/harcollected) was collected from wearable technologies such as _Jawbone Up_, _Nike FuelBand_, and _Fitbit_.  The goal is to investigate "how (well)" an activity was performed by the wearer, specifically to predict the manner in which wears did the exercise.
